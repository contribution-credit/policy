## Contributions and credit policy

We welcome good faith contributions to this policy. We are most interested in additions that come from direct personal experience, or that are in policies in use by open source projects. We also welcome edits to improve clarity, grammar, or spelling. We discourage non-trivial contributions made through automation, such as using an LLM to rewrite prose.

To contribute changes to the text of the policy or related documentation, create a pull request against the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/contribution-credit/policy) and include an edit to add your name to the [CREDITS](https://github.com/contribution-credit/policy/blob/main/CREDITS) file in your pull request. If you contribute in ways other than changing the text, please also create a pull request to add yourself to the credits. If you don't know how to make a pull request, please contact the repository owners.

We aim to review and act on all pull requests within one month of their submission. If we do not, please contact the repository owners. If we need to edit your contribution, we will check it in with your name as the primary author, and the person editing it as a secondary author.

If you notice that credit has been recorded incorrectly, please contact the repository owners. We aim to respond within one month.

This policy also applies to itself.

### Naming convention

Names for credit are whatever name the person being credited prefers. We accept any UTF-8 string of reasonable length as a name. If a person's name has changed, please create a pull request editing the credits section of this document together with the git .mailmap file (if applicable). We reserve the right to reject names that appear to be chosen with some goal other than identifying the contributor.
