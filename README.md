# Contributions and Credits Policy

This repository stores the Contributions and Credits Policy templates, as well
as other information around this topic. For now, it's a work in progress.

We started with [Valerie Aurora's talk](https://ripe87.ripe.net/archives/video/1218)
at RIPE 87 Meeting in Rome, followed by two mailing-list rounds:
[First draft](https://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/opensource-wg/2023-December/000218.html)
and [Second draft](https://www.ripe.net/ripe/mail/archives/opensource-wg/2024-January/000236.html).

If you wish to contribute now, please wait until we finish our drafting
process. This should happen during March 2024, hopefully.
